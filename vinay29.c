// EXAMPLE:
    // Employee 1:
    // Enter no of characters in your eId
    // 45
    // Dynamically allocate the character array.
    // take input from user 

    // Employee 2:
    // Enter no of characters in your eId
    // 4
    // Dynamically allocate the character array.
    // take input from user 

    // Employee 3:
    // Enter no of characters in your eId
    // 9
    // Dynamically allocate the character array.
